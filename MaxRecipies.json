Place the cut bulb in a piece of aluminium foil large enough to tightly wrap the entire bulb. Drizzle with the oil so that it coats the exposed cloves and drips down the outside of the bulb.\n\nWrap the entire head of garlic tightly in aluminium foil.\n\nSet the air fryer to 390°F/198°C. Put the foil-wrapped garlic in the air fryer basket or cooking pan for oven type air fryers. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until it begins to caramelize and turn golden brown.\n\nStart checking the garlic around the 20 minute mark. Open the foil carefully using oven mitts and tongs. If not done, return to the air fryer and continue cooking in 2 minute intervals.\n\nHint: no matter how tightly you wrap the garlic, oil is likely to leak out! Make sure you have a drip pan underneath to catch it.\n\nWhen done, remove with your tongs and oven mitts. Let it cool for about 10 minutes before removing from the shell.\n\nWhen ready to use, squeeze the garlic bulb gently so the cloves easily slide out of the shells.\n\nAnd enjoy!\n\nYes, you can. One way is to put the garlic bulb in a baking dish and rub with the oil. Then air fry for 10 minutes, or until the top caramelizes but doesn't burn.\n\nThe other way is to separate and peel the garlic cloves, toss them with olive oil and put on a piece of parchment paper or on a cooking pan. Air fry for 10 minutes, then toss. Continue cooking in 2 minute increments until they begin to caramelize and turn golden brown.\n\nWith either method, use approximately 1 tablespoon of oil per head of garlic.\n\nHow To Store\n\nStore in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Put the cloves in a glass jar and fill with enough oil to cover them. Cover tightly. The garlic can be removed from the oil when ready to use, or you can use the oil as well.\n\nRoasted garlic is freezer-friendly for up to 3 months. It can be stored as whole garlic cloves, mashed into a puree, or submerged in oil. You can store the garlic submerged in oil in use ice cube trays and pop out the cubes to defrost as needed.\n\nKeeping the garlic bulb in its shell, slice the bottom off (the side with the brown part) of the bulb to expose the inner cloves.\n\nPlace the cut bulb in a piece of aluminium foil large enough to tightly wrap the entire bulb.

    "directions": "Before you begin: decide when you want to make the dough. The instructions (below) outline a long, overnight rise @ 68-70 F (20-21 C) Alternatively, you can rise the dough during the day. Please refer to the sample schedules in the post above and choose what suits your needs.\n\nMake the Dough: In the evening: whisk the sourdough starter, water and honey together in a large bowl (I use a fork for mixing). Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine and then finish by hand to form a rough dough. It will be wet and sticky. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour. Timing is flexible here. Then return to the bowl and work the dough into a ball.\n\nBulk Rise: Cover the bowl of dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap (or transfer the dough to a lightly oiled dough container). Let the dough rise overnight at room temperature, approximately 68-70 F (20-21 C) for about 12+ hours. The dough will double in size (or more) when ready. Note: if the weather is warmer than 68- 70 F (20-21 C) the dough will rise faster than 12+ hrs. Please adjust your timeframes accordingly.\n\nSecond Rise: In the morning, pour 2 tbsp. of olive oil onto a rimmed sheet pan (or 1 tbsp. olive oil if using a non-stick rectangular pan). Use your hands to evenly coat the bottom and sides. With your oiled hands, remove the dough onto the pan, and then flip it to coat both sides. Cover and let rest for 1 1/2- 2 hours or until very puffy (I use an inverted sheet pan to cover the dough). Preheat your oven to 425 F (220 C). Note: I like to rest my dough in a warm spot, usually on top of the oven while it preheats. The dough becomes soft and bubbly.\n\nAssemble the Focaccia: Right before baking, gently dimple the dough with oiled fingertips. I start at the bottom of the pan and work my way to the top. As you dimple, the dough will naturally begin to stretch outwards. You should end up with a rustic rectangular or oval shape, about 14 x 9-inches (36 x 23 cm) or larger. The dough won’t go all the way to the corners and sides of the sheet pan- this is OK. Note: If using a rectangular pan, the dough will naturally fill the shape of the pan.\n\nAdd Focaccia Toppings (optional): Press your preferred toppings into the dough. As the focaccia rises, the dough will puff up. The toppings will pop out if not properly anchored. If using garlic, I keep the cloves wrapped in their papery peels to prevent burning. Remove and discard the peels before eating.\n\nBake the Focaccia: Place the dough onto the center rack. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before cutting. TIP: To par-bake focaccia dough: Bake for approximately 15-18 minutes @ 425 F (220 C). The crust will be set, very pale in color and golden underneath. Remove the focaccia from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Once completely cool, wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 6 hrs. To finish, return to the pan and bake for 12-15 minutes.\n\nTo serve, cut the focaccia into wedges or squares and enjoy warm!",

Stir in dill, chopped hard-boiled eggs, and pepper. Taste and adjust salt. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. If using ricotta you can either stir it into the cabbage or place a teaspoon on each round of dough before topping with the cabbage mixture.\n\nWhen the dough is ready, pinch off 24 equal pieces, approximately 20 grams each, and roll each one into a small ball by cupping your hand over it and gently rolling it against your work surface.

Put a cup or two of flour in a large bowl, add half the chicken and tumble the legs around to coat.\n\nSet a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl in 2 tablespoons oil or butter and allow to melt and foam. Shake excess flour off the chicken legs and slide them into the hot pan in one layer; adjust the heat so the legs are sizzling nicely.

Remove the chicken to a platter and repeat with remaining legs, adding more oil or butter if the pan seems dry.\n\nPour off the grease in the pan and add the wine or other liquid to the skillet, scraping at the sticky bits.

Add garlic, thyme and bay leaf and cook for a minute or so, then return all the chicken to the pan, skin side up, along with the reserved glazing liquid and between 1 and 3 cups stock or water, enough to come up the sides of the chicken but not to get them swimming. Bring to a simmer and then put the skillet in the oven.\n\nAfter 5 minutes or so, reduce the oven heat to 325 degrees and cook until chicken is very tender, 30 to 40 minutes. (Test for doneness by inserting a slender-bladed knife into the meat. It should pull out easily.) Remove the skillet from the oven, lift the legs from the skillet and put them aside again. Pour the liquid contents of the skillet into a small bowl and allow it to sit for 5 minutes or so, letting the fat rise to the surface.

    "directions": "Make the preferment: In a medium bowl, combine the yeast and ¼ cup/57 grams warm tap water (100 to 110 degrees), and whisk until the yeast is dissolved. Add another ½ cup/113 grams room temperature water and the bread flour, and stir with a flexible spatula or bowl scraper until you have a smooth, pasty mixture with no dry spots. It should look like a thick batter.\n\nScrape the mixture into the center of the bowl and cover tightly. Let the preferment sit at room temperature until it’s nearly tripled in size, extremely bubbly across the surface, and jiggles on the verge of collapsing when the bowl is shaken, 1 to 2 hours (depending on the ambient temperature).\n\nIf making a raisin-studded challah, while the preferment is getting bubbly, place the raisins in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water. Cover the bowl and let the raisins soak until they’re plumped and softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the raisins, pat them dry, and set aside.\n\nMix the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, olive oil, the yolk and 2 of the eggs until smooth, then add to the bowl with the preferment. Add the bread flour and salt. Use a flexible spatula or bowl scraper to stir the mixture, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate the preferment, until a shaggy dough comes together.\n\nKnead the dough: Generously flour the work surface, then scrape the dough and any floury bits out of the bowl and onto the surface (reserve the bowl). Generously flour the dough. Use the heel of your hands to knead the dough, adding flour as needed if the dough is sticking to your hands or the surface, until the dough is very smooth, elastic and slightly tacky, 10 to 15 minutes. (You can also combine everything in a stand mixer and mix on low speed with the dough hook for 8 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.)\n\nTest the dough: Pinch off a golf ball-size piece and flatten it with your fingertips. Stretch the dough outward in all directions gently and slowly: You should be able to form a sheet of dough that’s thin enough to allow light to pass through without tearing. If the dough tears, continue kneading. For a raisin-studded challah, use your hands to flatten the dough into a 1-inch-thick slab (the shape doesn’t matter) and scatter the drained raisins over the dough. Roll up the dough and gather it back into a ball, then knead until the raisins are distributed throughout.\n\nLet the dough rise: Gather the dough into a smooth ball, dust lightly with flour and place back in the reserved bowl. Cover and let the dough sit in a warm spot until it’s doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours (depending on the ambient temperature).\n\nDivide the dough: Punch down the dough inside the bowl to expel the gasses that built up during the first rise, then scrape the dough out onto a clean work surface. For a braided loaf, use a bench scraper or knife to divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. (You can eyeball it, or weigh the pieces for accuracy — each piece should weigh 180 to 190 grams.) For a round loaf, divide the dough in half.\n\nBraid or twist the dough: For a braid, roll each of the 6 pieces into snakes measuring about 18 inches long and slightly tapered at the ends. Dust the strands in flour to coat them lightly, then line them up so they’re side by side. Pinch together the ends of the strands to connect them at the top.\n\nTake the strand on the far right and cross it over the other strands, so it’s all the way on the far left side, placing it perpendicular to the other strands. Then, take the strand that was originally on the far left, and is now second from the left, and bring it all the way to the far right, also placing it perpendicularly.\n\nFan out the remaining strands so there’s a generous space in the center. Take the strand on the far left and bring it to the center, but group it with the strands on the right. Next, bring the strand that’s second from the right and cross it over to the far left, also placing it perpendicular. Then, fan out the strands again, leaving a space in the center, and bring the strand on the far right to the center, grouping it with the strands on the left. Bring the strand second from the left to the far right and cross it over to the far left. Then, repeat this process until you’ve braided the entire length of the strands, tugging gently on the strands as you work to create tension in the braid. Pinch the ends of the braids and tuck them underneath the loaf, then transfer to a parchment-lined sheet pan. Make sure you have a couple of inches of clearance on either side of the braid so it can expand.\n\nAlternatively, for a round, roll the two pieces of dough into long snakes measuring about 28 inches long, making sure to taper the snakes at one end. Dust the strands in flour to coat them lightly, then line them up so they’re side by side with the tapered ends aligned. Twist the two strands together, then start at the tapered end and roll up the twist into a tight coil, wrapping the fatter end around and tucking the end underneath the coil. Transfer the coil to a parchment-lined sheet pan.\n\nEgg wash and proof the dough: Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl until it’s streak-free. Brush the loaf with the egg, then loosely cover the dough with some lightly oiled plastic wrap on a sheet pan, and let it rise at room temperature until it’s doubled in size, extremely puffy, and springs back but holds a slight indentation when poked gently with a wet finger, another 1½ to 2 hours (but possibly longer, depending on ambient temperature). The dough is easy to underproof, so, if you’re unsure, err on the side of overproofing. (The round loaf will also take longer to proof.) Alternatively, before proofing, you can refrigerate the dough overnight, but omit the egg wash and make sure it’s covered (plastic should cover it loosely but be sealed around the pan so the dough doesn't dry out).\n\nHeat the oven: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and heat it to 350 degrees.\n\nBake: Uncover the challah and brush with another layer of egg wash. Sprinkle the loaf with poppy or sesame seeds (if using) and bake until the loaf is shiny and burnished, an instant-read thermometer registers 190 degrees when inserted into the center, and it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the challah cool completely on the baking sheet.",

    "directions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.\n\nTo make the starter: Mix everything together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.\n\nTo make the dough: Mix and knead everything together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nPlace the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for 45 minutes. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces.\n\nRound each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to 1 hour, if that works better with your schedule.\n\nWorking with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.\n\nTurn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.\n\nWith the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16\" log. Your goal is a 15\" baguette, so 16\" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical \"pointy\" end.\n\nPlace the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (\"marshmallow-y\" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).\n\nTowards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a cast iron pan on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.\n\nIf your baguettes have risen in a dish towel or couche, gently roll them (seam side down) onto a lightly greased (or parchment-lined) baking sheet. If you plan on baking them on a baking stone, roll them onto a piece of parchment, and lift the parchment onto a baker's peel.\n\nUsing a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.\n\nLoad the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.\n\nBake the baguettes — on the pan, or on a stone — for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2\", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.\n\nStorage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage. Thaw and reheat just before serving.",

Add mustard and 3 tablespoons olive oil and, using a fork, whisk to blend. Season with salt and more pepper, if needed.\n\nBring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently lower in 4 large eggs and boil for 8 minutes. Remove from heat and run cold water over to quickly chill. (You could throw a few ice cubes into the bowl as well.) Once the eggs are properly chilled, peel them and set them aside until you’re ready to assemble the salad.\n\nMeanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool. Once cool enough to handle, coarsely chop bacon and set aside.\n\nDrain all but roughly 2 tablespoons bacon grease from the skillet.

(Alternatively, chop or slice it into bite-sized pieces.) Slice or chop the hard-boiled eggs.\n\nArrange lettuce in your largest serving bowl or platter.

Add the peppercorns, bay leaf and 1 section of the lemon to the water, and allow it to come to a bare simmer. Place the fish into this poaching liquid, and cook, barely simmering, until the flesh has just begun to whiten all the way through, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully remove the fish from the water, and set aside to cool.\n\nEmpty the pan, and return it to the stove, over medium-high heat. Add the butter, and allow it to melt, swirling it around the pan. When the butter foams, add the celery, onions and garlic, and sauté, stirring often, until the vegetables soften and the onions turn translucent, then transfer them to a large bowl.\n\nIn a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, eggs, salt, pepper and seasoning salt (or paprika and hot-pepper flakes), then add this mixture to the bowl with the sautéed vegetables, pour the crushed saltines or bread crumbs over them and stir to combine. Add the parsley, and stir again.\n\nFlake the cooked fish into the binding sauce carefully, keeping the flakes as whole as you can manage, then gather them into small balls, and form them into patties, 4-6 for a main course, 6-8 for an appetizer. Place them on a sheet pan or platter, cover loosely with plastic wrap and transfer them to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set.\n\nSet a large sauté pan over high heat, and add to it the neutral oil. When the oil is shimmering, remove the fish cakes from the refrigerator, and carefully sauté the patties until they are golden brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes a side. Work in batches if necessary. (A small smear of mayonnaise on the exterior of the patties will give them a crisp crust.)

    "directions": "Prepare the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together the egg whites, soy sauce, cornstarch (cornflour), 1/2 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper just until there aren’t any lumps, about 30 seconds. Working one breast at a time, place the chicken between 2 pieces of parchment paper and use a meat mallet (or the bottom of a pan) to pound the chicken evenly so it’s a scant 1/2-inch/1-centimeter thick. Transfer to the egg white bowl and continue with the remaining. Stir everything together gently to coat, and refrigerate to marinate for at least an hour (or overnight if you’re getting ahead).\n\nMeanwhile make the preserved lemon paste: Add all the ingredients to a small, lidded saucepan set over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the rinds start to look translucent and the juice has reduced by about half. Set aside to cool slightly, then transfer everything to a small food processor and blitz until you have a smooth, spreadable paste. (You should have about 1/4 cup.) Set aside 3 tablespoons for the sauce, then store the rest in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 4 weeks.\n\nMake the sauce: Add the 3 tablespoons preserved lemon paste, the stock, butter, garlic, sugar, turmeric and half the cumin to a medium saucepan, then place it over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, until reduced by about a third. Measure out roughly 3 tablespoons of the sauce into a small bowl, then add the cornstarch (cornflour) and whisk until there are no lumps. Whisk this back into the sauce pot and cook for 1 minute, whisking continuously, until smooth and thickened slightly. Remove from the heat.\n\nHeat the oil in a large high-sided frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot (a sprinkle of cornstarch dropped into the oil should sizzle right away), fry two of the chicken breasts for 3 minutes per side, or until nicely browned and just cooked through. It should release easily from the skillet with a little help from a metal spatula. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and continue with the remaining 2 breasts. It might spit, so turn down the heat if needed. Wipe out the frying pan, add the sauce and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add back all the chicken breasts and cook for just 3 minutes, gently turning them halfway. Remove from the heat and stir in the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.\n\nTransfer the chicken breasts (cut them into strips, if you like) to a large serving platter with a lip and pour the sauce all over.

    "directions": "To begin, place two small saucers or plates in the freezer. You will use these to test when the jam is set.\n\nSterilise the jars by heating in the oven. Full directions are in the recipe below.\n\nGather all of your ingredients.\n\nWash the plums and remove any blemishes. Cut the fruit in half, remove the stone and cut the pieces in half again.\n\nAdd the quartered plums, along with water, to a large, wide saucepan.\n\nBring the fruit to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook with the lid on until the fruit is soft.\n\nThen, add the sugar and lemon juice and stir until the sugar dissolves.\n\nBring the fruit to a rolling boil, stirring frequently.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, start to check for setting point. You will not have any trouble getting this jam to set as plums are high in pectin.\n\nIf your jam has any scum, remove it with a spoon.\n\nAlternatively, add a knob of butter and stir to remove the scum.\n\nAllow the jam to sit for 5 minutes to allow the fruit to settle.\n\nWhen ready, ladle the Plum Jam into hot, sterilised jars and seal with the lids. After cooling, wipe the jars to remove any spills, label with the date and jam variety and store in a cool, dark place.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Easy Plum Jam!\n\nTo Sterilise the Jars:\n\nPreheat the oven to 130 Degrees C (270F).\n\nUse glass jars, either new or recycled, with an airtight, metal lid. If recycling jars, ensure that the jars do not have cracks or chips and the lids are in good condition. Discard any lids that are pitted or rusted. Ensure your lids are oven safe or see our notes if they are not. (See Note 6.)\n\nWash the jars and lids. If washing by hand, use hot, soapy water and then rinse them well. Alternatively, wash them in the dishwasher.\n\nPlace jars and lids on a baking tray. Heat in the oven for at least 20 minutes. The jars and lids should be completely dry and remain very hot.\n\nTo Make the Jam:\n\nPlace 2 small plates or saucers in the freezer to chill – see Note 7.\n\nWash the plums and remove any blemishes. To halve the plums, start at the stem end and run a sharp knife around the plum, following the naturally occurring marking. Use the tip of the knife to remove the stones.\n\nCut the halves in half again. If you don’t want your jam to have chunks of fruit, cut the plums into eighths.\n\nPlace the plums and water in a large, wide saucepan. See Note 8.\n\nBring the plums to a simmer over low-medium heat. Stir occasionally using a long-handled wooden spoon. See Note 9.\n\nCover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the plums are soft, 15-20 minutes. At this stage, if you prefer less chunky jam, you could blend it using a hand-held stick blender. Take off the heat to do this.\n\nAdd the sugar and lemon juice. Stir frequently, with the saucepan uncovered, until the sugar dissolves.\n\nIncrease the heat and bring to a rolling boil for 5-15 minutes. You need to be vigilant at this point. Stir frequently to avoid the jam catching and burning on the bottom of the pan. Boiling time will vary depending on the size of your saucepan and the heat that you apply.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes rapid boiling, turn the heat off under the jam.\n\nSpoon a small amount of jam onto a chilled plate or saucer to check if it is starting to set. I use the wrinkle test. When the jam has cooled, push it gently with your fingertip. If it wrinkles, even slightly, it is ready.\n\nIf it remains liquid, put the jam back on the heat for a further 5 minutes and check again. See Note 10.\n\nYou can also use a thermometer to check for setting point. To use this method, you will need a sugar thermometer. Clip the thermometer to the side of your pan. When the thermometer reads 104C (220F) the jam is ready.\n\nWhen the jam reaches setting point, remove the pan from the heat. If there is any scum on the surface of the jam, add a teaspoon of butter and stir well. It will dissolve the scum.\n\nLet the jam stand for about 10 minutes to allow the fruit to settle. This will ensure that any pieces of fruit will be evenly distributed throughout the jam. Without standing, the fruit will rise to the top of the jar.\n\nThe jam will still be liquid when you ladle it into your jars. It can take up to 48 hours to completely set.\n\nStir the jam and carefully ladle it into the heated, sterilised jars. You need to be very careful. A splash or spill from hot jam would result in a serious burn. I recommend that you wear clothing with long sleeves. Additionally, this is not the occasion to have children nearby.\n\nImmediately seal the jars tightly with sterilised lids.\n\nWhen cool, remove any spills from the jars and label with the date and name. Store the jam in a cool, dark place.\n\nWhen using the jam, always use a clean, dry spoon to avoid contamination. After opening a jar, as a further precaution, store it in the refrigerator.\n\nLemon juice not only balances the sweetness of the sugar, but it also contains acid and pectin which help to set the jam.\n\nProperly sterilising your jars is an essential process to remove bacteria that could cause your preserves to spoil. Wash the jars and lids either in the dishwasher or by hand in hot soapy water, and rinse well. Do not dry them with a tea towel. Place jars and lids on a baking tray. If you are using Kilner jars with rubber seals, be sure to remove the seals before placing the jars in the oven. The dry heat of the oven would damage the seals. Boil the seals separately in a saucepan for about 10 minutes. If your lids are not oven safe, boil them for 10 minutes and allow them to air dry. Heat the jars in the oven for at least 20 minutes. When your preserves are ready to bottle, use thick oven mitts or jar tongs to remove the jars. Do not place them on a cold surface as they may shatter. I place mine on a wooden chopping board which I cover with a tea towel. Always sterilise a few more jars than you think you will need. It is better to have too many jars than not enough.\n\nThe chilled plates are used to quickly cool the jam when testing the setting point.\n\nAlways choose your widest saucepan that has enough height to enable the jam to boil vigorously. More surface area means the liquid will evaporate faster; having sufficient height means you can boil the jam at a higher heat and maintain the fresh flavour of the plums. Avoid aluminium, copper or iron pans; the acid in the fruit may react with the pan, giving the jam a metallic taste.\n\nDo not use a metal spoon, it will become very hot. A long-handled wooden spoon is important to avoid being burnt by a splash from boiling jam.\n\nMy jam reaches its setting point about 5 minutes after it begins to boil rapidly. Boiling time will vary depending on the size of your saucepan and the heat that you apply.\n\nIf your finished jam has not set as much as you would like, don’t worry, it will still be delicious stirred into some plain yoghurt or served over our No-churn Vanilla Ice Cream. Or, if it is slightly over-set and is very firm, it will be a lovely accompaniment on a cheese board.\n\nPlease note, the nutritional information is based on one whole jar. The nutritional information is an estimate only.",

If it’s warmer than 68 F the dough will take less time to rise. Alternatively, start in the morning and bake in the afternoon or evening.\n\nMix the Dough\n\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour, butter, sugar and salt. Mix on low speed until combined; the butter should look like crumbs.\n\nAdd the starter and warm water. Mix until the flour is fully absorbed (get in there with your hands to finish mixing). The dough will feel slightly sticky and elastic at this stage. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, replenish you starter with fresh flour and water.\n\nAfter the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook and run the machine on medium-low (#3 on a KitchenAid) for 6-8 minutes. The dough will feel soft and supple and not stick to your hands. If it does, add a dusting of flour.\n\nBulk Rise\n\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise overnight at room temperature (68 F) until double in size, about 10-12 hrs. Please refer to the Baking Schedule above for additional rise time options.\n\nShape the Dough\n\nIn the morning, coat an 8.5×4 inch loaf pan with butter.\n\nRemove the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently flatten the surface to release any large air bubbles.\n\nRoll the dough into a log tucking the ends underneath. Rest for 5-10 minutes. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you to tighten its shape. Using a bench knife, place the dough into the loaf pan seam side down.\n\nSecond Rise\n\nCover the dough with lightly oiled or buttered plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature until it has risen to about 1-inch above the rim of the pan (check the height by looking at the domed center portion of the dough). You are not looking for it to double in size. For timing, this can take anywhere from 1 1/2-2 hours (or more!) depending on temperature and the amount of sourdough starter used. Remember, the warmer it is, the faster the dough will rise. Refer to the “helpful tips” at the top of this post.\n\nPreheat your oven to 375 F. Note: For higher oven spring, preheat to 500 F instead. Reduce to 375 F once the dough goes into the oven and bake as directed.\n\nBake the Dough\n\nBake the dough on the center rack for about 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\nCool in the pan for at least 10 minutes, and then transfer to a rack to cool completely.\n\nThis sandwich loaf will stay fresh for up to 3 days, stored in a plastic bag at room temperature.",

Add vinegar or lemon juice and stir briefly to incorporate. Curds should begin forming almost immediately; stop stirring as soon as they've formed throughout the pot.\n\nWithout stirring, continue to hold curdled-milk mixture at 185°F for 20 minutes. It's okay if the temperature fluctuates down to 175°F (79°C) or up to 190°F (88°C), but try to keep it in that zone for the full 20 minutes.\n\nLine a fine-mesh strainer with paper towels or cheesecloth. Using a slotted spoon, transfer curds to strainer and let stand until excess liquid has drained away. Exactly how long to let it drain depends on whether you want a moister final product or a drier one. Do not try to pour all the milky liquid through the strainer, as this will clog it and prevent the liquid from flowing through.\n\nDrained ricotta can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days, though it is best when freshly made.\n\nI prefer not to add salt, since the ricotta can always be seasoned later, but feel free to add a pinch if you like.\n\nRicotta is best when freshly made, but once drained, it can be stored in the refrigerator, covered, for up to two days.",

    "directions": "Place flour, yeast, sugar, all spice, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Briefly mix with stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.\n\nAdd butter, milk, egg, sultanas and zest.\n\nStandmixer: Mix until a smooth elastic dough forms - 5 minutes on Speed 2 of standmixer. After 1 minute, add extra flour if required, just enough so dough comes away from side of bowl when mixing and doesn't stick terribly to your fingers. (Note 5).\n\nHand kneading: Alternatively, dust a work surface with flour and knead by hand for 10 minutes.\n\nRISE #1:\n\nLeave dough in the bowl, cover with cling wrap and place in a warm, wind free place to rise until doubled in size. This will take anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours depending on how warm it is - see Note 6.\n\nFORMING BALLS (WATCH VIDEO, IT'S HELPFUL):\n\nLine a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13\" tray with baking paper with overhang.\n\nRemove cling wrap and punch dough to deflate.\n\nDust work surface with flour, place dough on work surface, shape into a log - this will deflate the air. Cut into 12 equal pieces.\n\nTake one piece and press down with palm, then use your fingers to gather into a ball, then roll the dough briefly to form a ball. This stretches the dough on one side and that's how I get a nice smooth surface.\n\nPlace the ball with the smooth side up on the tray. Repeat with remaining dough. Line them up 3 x 4.\n\nRISE # 2:\n\nSpray a piece of cling wrap lightly with oil (any), then loosely place over the tray.\n\nReturn tray to warm place and leaver 30 - 45 minutes, until the dough has risen by about 75% (less than double in size).\n\nPartway through Rise #2, preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).\n\nBAKING/GLAZE:\n\nBake for 22 minutes, or until the surface is a deep golden brown. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe.\n\nMeanwhile, place jam and water in a bowl, microwave for 30 seconds. Mix to combine.\n\nRemove buns from oven. Use overhang to lift buns onto a cooling rack.\n\nBrush with jam mixture while warm. Allow to cool to warm before serving.\n\nPlace the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a medium bowl, then pour in water. Leave for 5 minutes until it froths.\n\nPlace flour, remaining sugar, salt and spices in a bowl. Whisk to combine.\n\nMake a well in the centre. Add remaining Buns ingredients and pour in the yeast liquid, including all froth.\n\nMix until combined with wooden spoon - it will be like a thick muffin batter. Not pourable, but thick and sticky.\n\nRISE #1:\n\nLeave dough in the bowl, cover with a wet (clean) tea towel and place in a warm place to rise for around 1 1/2 - 2 hours. See Note 5 for how I do this (you will laugh - but it works every time!). The dough will triple in size and be bubbly on the surface.\n\nFORMING BALLS (WATCH VIDEO, IT'S HELPFUL):\n\nLine a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13\" tray with baking paper with overhang.\n\nRemove tea towel and punch dough to deflate.\n\nDust work surface with flour, place dough on work surface. Dust top of dough then knead lightly (to deflating air) and shape into a log.

Go slow so it hugs the curves.\n\nBAKING/GLAZE:\n\nBake for 22 minutes, or until the surface is a deep golden brown. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe.\n\nMeanwhile, place jam and water in a bowl, microwave for 30 seconds. Mix to combine.\n\nRemove buns from oven.

    "directions": "Set a rack in the middle of the oven and another right below it. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with butter; set aside.\n\nPrepare the cream: In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low. Add the shallots, garlic and black peppercorns and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the half-and-half, bay leaves, thyme, nutmeg and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. \n\nStrain the seasoned cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. (You should have about 3 cups.) Return the cream to the saucepan off the heat. In the same bowl, whisk the egg yolks, then whisk in a few tablespoons of the warm cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, to temper the yolks. (Tempering prevents the cold yolks from scrambling when combined with the warm cream. The yolks will help your filling hold together.) Whisk the egg yolk mixture into the cream. Reserve and refrigerate 1 cup cream for serving. Rinse and dry the bowl.\n\nUsing a mandoline (or very sharp knife; see Tip), slice the unpeeled red potatoes crosswise 1/8-inch thick. In the bowl, toss the potatoes with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper until evenly seasoned, then stir the potatoes into the cream in the saucepan. (The warmth of the cream will help the potatoes start to cook.) Set aside.\n\nPeel, trim and halve the beets, then slice them 1/8-inch thick using a mandoline (or very sharp knife; see Tip). Add the beets to the bowl and toss with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Shingle the sliced beets in the baking dish, overlapping slightly, in two even layers, then sprinkle them evenly with 1 1/3 cups grated Gruyère. Wipe out the bowl to remove any beet juices.\n\nIn the bowl, season the sliced sweet potatoes with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Shingle them on top of the cheese-topped beets in 2 to 3 even layers, then press them gently to compress the vegetables evenly, eliminating any air pockets. Sprinkle the sweet potatoes with 1 1/3 cups grated Gruyère.\n\nIn the bowl, season the squash with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Shingle the squash over the cheese-topped sweet potatoes in 2 even layers, press to compress the mixture, then sprinkle the squash with the remaining 1 1/3 cups grated Gruyère. \n\nShingle the potatoes on top in 2 to 3 even layers, then slowly pour the remaining cream mixture evenly over the sliced vegetables. Set on the middle rack of the oven and place a large sheet pan directly underneath on the rack below to catch any drips. Bake until the vegetables start to soften, about 1 hour. \n\nAfter the vegetables have baked for about 40 minutes, prepare the phyllo: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Working on a large, clean surface, set 1 sheet of phyllo down. Brush lightly with melted butter then set a second sheet of phyllo on top. Take your hands and scrunch the phyllo into a 5 1/2-inch rosette with lots of folds. Push aside, then repeat with remaining 14 sheets of phyllo, creating 8 rosettes total. \n\nAfter the sliced vegetables have cooked for 1 hour, remove from the oven. Increase heat to 400 degrees. Using a paper towel, gently pat the surface to remove any liquid that may have risen to the surface, then cover the top with the 8 phyllo rosettes, scrunching them as needed to fit. Brush the phyllo generously with melted butter. \n\nBake until the phyllo is crisp and golden and the vegetables are tender and a paring knife slides easily through the center, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before slicing. (Patience is crucial; if you slice this before the liquids are reabsorbed, the gratin won’t form slices without slipping apart.) \n\nWhile the gratin firms up, reheat the reserved cream over medium until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season the warm sauce with salt and pepper.\n\nTo serve, cut the gratin in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise to form 12 even slices. Pass the sauce at the table, to spoon on the side.",

    "directions": "Make the dough: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the brown sugar in a small bowl and zest the orange directly over it. Gently rub the zest into the sugar and transfer 2 tablespoons/25 grams to a large bowl to use for the dough. Save the rest of the orange sugar for the filling.\n\nAdd the flour, baking powder and salt to the large bowl and whisk well. Add the butter and cream cheese, and smash and rub them into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until they’re fully incorporated and the mixture resembles crumbs.\n\nAdd the milk all at once and stir gently with a fork until the dough comes together and no dry bits remain. Freeze while you prepare the pan and filling. Very generously butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan or ovenproof skillet.\n\nMake the filling: Mix the cinnamon (and cardamom, if using) into the reserved orange sugar.\n\nScrape the dough onto a well-floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough or flour your hands to pat the dough into a 12-by-5-inch rectangle. It may be sticky, but that’s OK. Just flour the dough enough to be able to shape it.\n\nTo fill the dough, spread the very soft butter evenly over the surface, then sprinkle the orange sugar on top. Starting with one long side of the dough, roll it up into a 12-inch-long log. If it’s stuck to the surface, scrape it up as you roll it using a bench scraper or stiff spatula.\n\nUse a serrated knife to cut the log with a sawing motion into 8 (1 1/2-inch-thick) slices. Place a slice in the center of the pan, then space the remaining slices 1/2-inch apart around it. At this point, the rolls can be covered and chilled for up to 2 days before baking directly from the refrigerator.\n\nBake until golden on top, 23 to 25 minutes. You don’t want to overbake, but also want the dough to be cooked through. When you press the top, the roll shouldn’t sink but spring back just a little.\n\nIf you’d like to glaze the rolls, make the glaze while the rolls bake: Place the cream cheese then the confectioners’ sugar in a bowl. Zest the orange directly over the sugar, then mix and smush together until smooth. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons orange juice and mix well. The glaze should be a bit thick because it will loosen when it hits the hot rolls. Taste and add more confectioners’ sugar if you’d like. Stir in more juice if it’s too stiff.\n\nLet the rolls cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then spread the glaze all over them. Cool a bit longer to serve hot or warm.",

    "directions": "Make the crust: Pulse the pecans in a food processor until coarsely ground. Add the flour, confectioners’ sugar and salt, and pulse until the nuts are very finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until fully incorporated, then add the egg and vanilla, and pulse just until the dough comes together in large clumps.\n\nButter the bottom and sides of a standard (not deep-dish) 9-inch pie plate. Take about two-thirds of the dough (300 grams) and press into an even layer against the bottom of the plate and up the sides to form a 1/3-inch-thick crust along the sides. The top of the dough should extend just over the inside edge of the rim. Refrigerate until firm. Meanwhile, position 1 rack on the lowest level of the oven and 1 near the top. Heat the oven to 325 degrees.\n\nWhile the oven heats, prepare the remaining one-third of the dough (about 165 grams). Pinch off a 1-inch ball of dough and refrigerate it in case you need to patch any cracks in the crust. Press the rest of the dough into a round disk on a sheet of parchment paper. If it is very sticky, refrigerate it until it’s easy to roll. If it isn’t too sticky, place a piece of plastic wrap over it and roll it into a 7-inch round. You also can pat it into a 7-inch round if you don’t have a rolling pin. Freeze on the parchment on a baking sheet until firm but not extremely hard.\n\nCut the dough into 4 even strips, then cut 4 even strips at an angle, starting the cuts from the end points of the first set of strips. You want to create 2 diamonds in the middle and 8 triangles with curved edges surrounding them. (Or get creative and cut whatever shapes you’d like.) Refrigerate until firm.\n\nLine the dough with a sheet of crumpled parchment paper. (Crumpling helps it lie flat against the dough.) Fill the lined dough to the top with pie weights, such as dried beans. Bake on the lowest rack until golden at the edges and dry, about 25 minutes. Remove the parchment with the pie weights and return the empty shell to the oven. Bake until golden brown at the edges and set on the bottom, 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool while you prepare the filling. If there are any cracks in the dough, gently press pieces of the reserved dough into them. Be sure to patch everything, but you don’t need to bake the shell by itself again.\n\nMake the filling: In a large bowl, whisk the corn syrup, brown sugar, butter, eggs, rye (if using), vanilla and salt until smooth. Stir in the pecans. Pour the filling into the crust and bake on the lowest rack until set, 40 to 45 minutes, tenting with foil if the top or crust get too dark. It may still wobble a bit but shouldn’t jiggle.\n\nMeanwhile, lift the refrigerated dough shapes off the parchment and place them back down, spacing them 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake on the upper rack while the pie bakes until golden brown at the edges, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool completely. (The pecan sandies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.)\n\nCool the pie completely. (The whole pie can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days before topping.)\n\nMelt the chocolate (in a microwave-safe bowl stirring every 20 seconds or in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water). If you’d like, dust the tops of some or all of the cooled pecan sandies with confectioners’ sugar. Generously spread melted chocolate on the bottoms and arrange the shapes on top of the cooled pie. Let the chocolate set. Serve immediately or let stand at room temperature for up to 8 hours.",

    "directions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all of the ingredients, kneading to form a smooth dough.\n\nAllow the dough to rise, in a lightly greased, covered bowl, until it's doubled in size, about 90 minutes.\n\nGently divide the dough in half; it'll deflate somewhat. Preshape each piece of dough by pulling the edges into the center, turning it over so the seam is on the bottom, and rolling under your cupped hands to form a ball. Let the dough rest, covered, for 15 minutes.\n\nTo make fat oval loaves, elongate each ball of dough you've preshaped by gently rolling it back and forth on an unfloured work surface several times. For longer loaves, continue rolling until they're about 10\" to 11\" long.\n\nPlace the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F.\n\nSpray the loaves with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour.\n\nMake two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread knife wielded firmly or a lame, works well here.\n\nBake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes, until it's a very deep golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack.\n\nTips from our Bakers\n\nWhy the range in yeast amount? If you're sure your starter is healthy and vigorous, and you don't mind potentially extending somewhat the rise times listed above, use 1 teaspoon yeast. If your starter seems a bit lethargic (or you want to keep your rise times on the shorter side), go with 2 teaspoons.\n\nFor an assertively sour loaf, read our recipe for Extra-Tangy Sourdough Bread.\n\nWant to make a loaf with an even chewier, crustier crust? See our blog post, Baking bread in a Dutch oven.\n\nDon’t have any starter? Here’s a recipe for homemade sourdough starter. If you're making it from scratch, you'll need to feed it for 5 to 7 days before it’s ready for baking. Want a head start? Purchase our classic fresh sourdough starter – it’ll be ready for baking soon after it arrives at your door. Looking for tips, techniques, and all kinds of great information about sourdough baking? Find what you need in our sourdough baking guide.\n\nTo make sourdough with fruit and nuts: If you'd like one of the two loaves in this recipe to be chockfull of fruit and nuts, knead 3/4 cup (96g) Baker’s Fruit Blend and 1/2 cup (57g) toasted mixed nuts of your choice into half the dough after you divide it and before you preshape it (step 3). Proceed with the recipe as otherwise written.",

    "directions": "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water, warm milk, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the butter, salt, and 1 cup flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then add another cup of flour. Beat on medium speed until relatively incorporated (there may still be chunks of butter). Add the remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. *If you do not own a mixer, you can mix this dough with a large wooden spoon or rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle!*\n\nKnead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 3 minutes or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 3 minutes. (See video tutorial above if you need a visual of kneading dough by hand.)\n\n1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)\n\nGrease a 9×5 inch loaf pan.\n\nShape the bread: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 8×15 inches. It does not have to be perfect– in fact, it will probably be rounded on the edges. That’s ok! Roll it up into an 8 inch log and place in the prepared loaf pan.\n\n2nd Rise: Cover shaped loaf with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until it’s about 1 inch above the top of the loaf pan, about 1 hour. (See video and photo above for a visual.)\n\nAdjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). (It’s best to bake the bread towards the bottom of the oven so the top doesn’t burn.)\n\nBake the bread: Bake for 30-34 minutes or until golden brown on top. If you gently tap on the loaf, it should sound hollow. For a more accurate test, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer reads the center of the loaf as 195°F (90°C). If you notice the top browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. (I usually add aluminum foil over the loaf around the 20 minute mark.) Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Feel free to let it cool completely before slicing, too.\n\nCover leftover bread tightly and store at room temperature for 2-3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.",

    "directions": "Mix the dough. Place the starter, salt, and water in a large bowl. Stir with a spatula to combine — it doesn’t have to be uniformly mixed. Add the flour. Mix again until the flour is completely incorporated. Transfer to a straight-sided vessel (if you have one.) Cover vessel with tea towel or cloth bowl cover and let stand 30 minutes.\n\nStretch and fold: after 30 minutes have passed, reach into the vessel and pull the dough up and into the center. Turn the vessel quarter turns and continue this pulling 8 to 10 times. See video for guidance. Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes; then repeat the stretching and folding. If possible, repeat this cycle twice more for a total of 4 stretch and folds. By the 4th cycle, you will notice a huge difference in the texture of the dough: it will be smoother, stronger, and more elastic.\n\nBulk fermentation: Cover vessel with a tea towel or bowl cover and set aside to rise at room temperature (70ºF/21ºC) for 4 to 18 hours (the time will vary depending on the time of year, the strength of your starter, and the temperature of your kitchen; see notes above) or until the dough has roughly doubled in volume. (UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If you’ve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel my dough is even stronger in the end.) Note: Do not use your oven with the light on for the bulk fermentation — it is too warm for the dough. When determining when the bulk fermentation is done, it is best to rely on visual cues (doubling in volume) as opposed to time. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly doubled.\n\nPortion and shape: Turn the dough out onto a work surface and shape into a rough ball, using as much flour as needed — the dough will be sticky. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Sprinkle portions with flour. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. Transfer each round of dough to a plastic quart container, cover, and store in fridge for at least 6 hours or up to 3 days or transfer to the freezer (see notes in post about thawing).\n\nMake the pizzas: Pull out a round (or more) of dough from the fridge one hour before you plan on baking. Dust dough with flour and place on a floured work surface. Let sit untouched for about an hour (a little longer or shorter is fine). Place a Baking Steel or pizza stone in the top third of your oven. Set oven to 550ºF. Heat oven for at least 45 minutes but ideally 1 hour prior to baking.\n\nShape the dough: Gently shape dough into a 10-inch (roughly) round handling it as minimally as possible. (See video for guidance.) Lay a sheet of parchment paper on top of a pizza peel. Transfer the dough round to the parchment-lined peel.\n\nTop and Bake\n\nTo make a classic Margherita-style pizza: Spread 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce over the surface of the dough. Top with mozzarella to taste. Sprinkle with parmesan to taste. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Sprinkle with basil, if you have it. Cut and serve. Discard parchment paper.\n\nTo make a kale and crème fraîche pizza: Place the kale in a small bowl, drizzle with olive oil, season with sea salt, and toss. Spoon crème fraîche over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or so—I use about a tablespoon per pizza. Sprinkle with minced garlic and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Top with the kale. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 – 6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Cut and serve. Discard parchment paper.\n\nTo make a naked pizza with scallion oil: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet with 1/4 cup of minced scallions (or ramps!) and 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Keep it over low heat while you make the pizza. Spoon crème fraîche over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or so—I use about a tablespoon per pizza. Sprinkle with a handful of grated parmesan. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 – 6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. At this point, the scallions should be starting to “frizzle”. If they aren’t, crank up the heat until the oil is sizzling. Spoon a few tablespoons of the hot oil over the pizza (you’ll have extra oil). Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Cut and serve.",

    "directions": "First prepare the breadcrumbs by placing bread slices on a baking sheet, drizzling with olive oil toasting in the oven until golden brown and dry. Remove from the oven and immediately rub the toasts with the whole clove of garlic. Cool, then process the bread in a food processor until the crumbs are broken down fine.\n\nIn a very large sauté pan or deep skillet, combine olive oil and chopped garlic, then place the pan over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until fragrant (PHOTO 1).\n\nAdd the seasoned fish and chili flakes, and continue to stir for about 20 seconds (PHOTO 2). Add the wine and bring to a boil (PHOTO 3). Turn the fish pieces and cook for another minute (PHOTO 4).\n\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a plate. They will be just cooked through and still quite moist.\n\nMeanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook to al dente. Just before draining the pasta, remove about ½ cup pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta well.\n\nContinue to gently simmer the wine broth for another 3 minutes, or until reduced by one-third (PHOTO 5). Add ¼ cup pasta cooking water to the wine broth and add the drained spaghetti (PHOTO 6).\n\nPlace the pan back on medium-high heat. When the broth comes to a boil, add the sliced rapini (PHOTO 7), gently tossing it until it begins to wilt. Lower the heat, add the cooked fish, and parsley and toss everything together gently (PHOTO 8).\n\nAdd the lemon juice and more olive oil and toss. Add a bit more pasta cooking water from the reserved supply if it seems dry.\n\nImmediately transfer your spaghetti with cod and rapini to a large platter or individual bowls and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs before serving.\n\nEXPERT TIPS\n\nI use silicone tongs to toss everything together and to serve. Lift the spaghetti a little at a time with the tongs and place it on top of the broccoli rabe, repeating until everything is well combined. This helps the rabe wilt evenly. You'll also avoid making a big mess on your stovetop trying to stir everything together the traditional way.\n\nI wouldn't recommend doubling this recipe to make in a single skillet. It can be a bit difficult to mix all the ingredients evenly from the point you add the spaghetti onward.\n\nIt's perfectly ok if your pieces of fish start to flake and fall apart a bit as you mix them into the pasta. It will still taste delicious. Also, you want them to reheat in the spaghetti mixture after having set them aside earlier in the process.\n\nPrepare the breadcrumbs. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Place the bread slices on a baking sheet, drizzle or spray with olive oil and place the sheet in the oven. Toast the bread until golden brown and dry, rotating the tray so the bread toasts evenly, about 40 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven and immediately rub the toasts with the whole clove of garlic. Allow to cool. Process the bread in a food processor until the crumbs are broken down fine. You may have a few chunks that won't break down, but you can remove them and snack on them or discard them. You will likely have more breadcrumbs than you'll need. Set aside.\n\nSlice rapini cross-wise about ½-inch wide beginning at the top of the bunch, and then thinner as you near the middle where there are more stems. Discard the thick stems at the bottom, or save them to cook in soup. Set the cut rapini aside.\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and salt generously.\n\nSeason the fish pieces with salt and set aside.\n\nIn a very large sauté pan or deep skillet, combine 2 tablespoons olive oil with the chopped garlic. Place the pan over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the garlic is fragrant.\n\nAdd the seasoned fish and chili flakes, and continue to stir for about 20 seconds. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Turn the fish pieces and lower the flame, bringing the ingredients to an easy simmer. Cook for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a plate. They will be just cooked through and still quite moist.\n\nContinue to gently simmer the wine broth for another 3 minutes, or until reduced by one-third. Turn off the heat.\n\nMeanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook to al dente. Just before draining the pasta, remove about ½ cup pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta well.\n\nAdd ¼ cup pasta cooking water to the wine broth and add the drained spaghetti. Place the pan back on medium-high heat. When the broth comes to a boil, add the sliced rapini, gently tossing it until it begins to wilt. Lower the heat, add the cooked fish, and parsley and toss everything together gently. Taste a strand of pasta to check the seasoning for salt.\n\nAdd the lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss. The pasta should be moist, but not too brothy. Add a bit more pasta cooking water from the reserved supply if necessary. Immediately transfer the pasta to a large platter or individual bowls and sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and serve.",

    "directions": "You start by prepping the peppers. Remove a thin layer from their top, remove the seeds and membranes, then cut a slit down their side.\n\nThe next step: cooking tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices in some olive oil.\n\nNext, you remove the pan from the heat and mix in cooked shredded chicken, mozzarella, and cilantro.\n\nNow, stuffthe tasty chicken mixture into the poblanos and bake them in a broiler-safe pan.\n\nThe very last step is to sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top of the peppers and broil them just to melt the cheese.\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\nIf you can only find small peppers, you can use them to make this recipe, using 8-10 of them instead of four.\n\nThey might need slightly less time in the oven, but not necessarily. As you can see in the video below, I used 3 medium ones and 4 small ones (that's what was available at the farmers' market) and baked them all together for 30 minutes. They all turned out great!\n\nPreheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large rimmed oven and broiler-safe baking sheet with foil and spray it with oil.\n\nRinse and dry the poblanos. Cut a thin slice off the tops and remove the core and seeds. Cut a slit all the way down the side of each pepper. Set aside.\n\nHeat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tomatoes, onion, garlic, salt, oregano, and cumin. Cook, stirring often, until liquids have evaporated, 5-7 minutes. Off heat, stir in the chicken, the mozzarella and the cilantro, mixing well.\n\nDivide the filling among the peppers, adding it from the top and pressing on it to fill the entire pepper. Pack the filling into each pepper to prevent it from spilling onto the baking sheet.\n\nPlace the peppers on the prepared baking sheet, slit side up. Lightly spray them with olive oil. Bake until the poblanos are soft and charred in places, about 30 minutes (the smell will be amazing!).\n\nRemove the baking sheet from the oven and switch the oven to broil. Top the peppers with the cheddar cheese, sprinkling the cheese on the open part where you've cut the slit.\n\nBroil the peppers 6 inches below the heating element (not directly below) just until the cheese is melted, 1-2 minutes. Let them rest for 5 minutes before serving.",

    "directions": "Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.\n\nPlace dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.\n\nTransfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home.\n\nAfter dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough.\n\nIn a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.\n\nTightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be.\n\nCut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces.\n\nPlace cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls.\n\nTo make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy!",

    "directions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.\n\nStir together all of the ingredients (except the cornmeal) in a large bowl, starting with 4 1/2 cups of the flour. Use a sturdy spoon, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.\n\nIf you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about 6 minutes. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.\n\nIf you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.\n\nPlace the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with vegetable oil or cooking spray; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.\n\nGently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.\n\nWorking with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.\n\nPlace the loaves, seam-side down, on a baking sheet (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with cornmeal; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.\n\nLet the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for 45 minutes. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.\n\nTowards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.\n\nFor extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty cast-iron frying pan on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.\n\nWhen your bread is risen, use a sieve to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf; these slashes will help the bread rise evenly as it bakes. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door. Wear good oven mitts during this process to shield your hands and arms from the steam.\n\nBake the bread for 20 to 25 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.\n\nTurn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for 5 additional minutes; this helps keep the crust crisp. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.\n\nStore the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days. Freeze for longer storage.\n\nTips from our Bakers\n\nNo instant yeast? You can use an equal amount of active dry yeast instead. Add it along with the other ingredients, no proofing necessary.\n\nBake it better! Watch King Arthur baker/blogger Kye Ameden demonstrate one of the techniques from this recipe: How to Knead Dough",

    "directions": "Wash your vegetables thoroughly and blanch them in a pot of boiling water. Transfer them to an ice bath to cool. Ring out all the water from the vegetables and chop very finely.\n\nIn a large bowl, stir together the vegetable, meat, wine, oil, sesame oil, salt, soy sauce, white pepper, and 2/3 cup water. Mix for 6-8 minutes, until very well-combined.\n\nTo wrap the dumplings, dampen the edges of each circle with some water. Put a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the circle in half and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two folds on each side, until the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s completely sealed. Repeat until all the filling is gone, placing the dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Make sure the dumplings aren’t sticking together.\n\nIf you’d like to freeze them, wrap the baking sheets tightly with plastic wrap and put the pans in the freezer. Allow them to freeze overnight. You can then take the sheets out of the freezer, transfer the dumplings to Ziploc bags, and throw them back in the freezer for use later.\n\nTo cook the dumplings, boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring a large pot of water to a boil, drop the dumplings in, and cook until they float to the top and the skins are cooked through, but still slightly al dente.\n\nTo pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes. Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated. Remove the cover, increase heat to medium-high and allow to fry for a few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings are golden brown and crisp.\n\nServe with soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, chili sauce, or other dipping sauce of your choice!\n\nTIPS \u0026 NOTES:\n\nFind the dumpling skins fresh at the Asian grocery store. Look for the white, round ones. If they start to dry out, wrap them in a damp paper towel and put them in a sealed plastic bag for a couple hours to soften back up.\n\nFreeze any unused dumpling wrappers in an airtight sealed plastic bag for later.",
